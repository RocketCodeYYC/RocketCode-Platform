This platform provides the stack necessary to kickstart development of a web application using modern technologies. RocketCode Platform is consisted of open source technologies which provides a strong foundation for application development. The front-end UI technology uses React (https://reactjs.org/), Ant Design is the UI component library (https://ant.design/), Parse Server being the BaaS (backend-as-a-service) (https://parseplatform.org/), and MongoDB (https://www.mongodb.com/) is the underlying database. There are various reasons and justifications contributing to the architectural decisions and technologies selections. RocketCode Platform only provides an application platform blueprint and a reference implementation, you also have the option to select different technologies by plugging and pulling different components from tech stack and tailor it to your own use case and requirements.
